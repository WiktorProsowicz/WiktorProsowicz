# About me

My name is Wiktor and I'm a software developer with a fair-sized amount of experience in object-oriented programming and knowledge about development of deep learning models. I study Computer Science and Intelligent Systems on [AGH UST](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/) in Cracow.

Main fields of my interests are:

- Digital signal processing, mainly sound analysis in deep learning
- Software development based on object-oriented programming
- Web/mobile apps development

My language of choice is C++, which I've had opportunity to work with for a while either at work or developing my private projects. I use also Python, mainly in projects related to development of ML models (I'm constantly broadening my experience with Tensorflow), for scripting and crating mobile apps.

| [ai_projects](https://github.com/WiktorProsowicz/ai_projects)|  A C++ framework that helps developing deep learning models. It contains tools written from scratch as well as data preprocessing algorithms. I use this project as a playground where I can train develop my C++ and software development proficiency                                                                                                                          |
| [sound-resurrection](https://github.com/WiktorProsowicz/sound-resurrection) | A Python project containing modules consisting on deep learning models performing various kinds of transformation on audio data. It is mainly dedicated to enhancing sound quality either by upsampling, denoising, completion etc. I use this project to train my Tensorflow proficiency and use in practice the learned knowledge in sound processing field |

| [OtterCards](https://github.com/WiktorProsowicz/OtterCards)      | A mobile app that can be used to compose and harvest easy-to-use flashcards and gain knowledge with their help. It was my first semi-serious project and its flaws help me compare my programming skills from various moments in my career             |
| [InzOprogProjekt](https://github.com/WiktorProsowicz/inz-oprog-projekt) | An internet forum for posting any type of information in textual form. Developed for purpose of university classes project |
